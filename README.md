# Hi there, I'm Hazel 👋

I'm a passionate **Data Analyst** with a **Scuba Diver’s** curiosity for exploring new depths - whether in data or the ocean. With **Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau**, I have experience in turning messy, raw data into clean datasets and clear, eye-catching dashboards for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Projects

### 1. [Student Retention Analysis](https://github.com/tthvan/MVA-Retention-Analysis.git)
This project analyzes **student retention** and **dropout rates**, which directly impact the organization's revenue. The insights were presented to the Founder and Head of the TA-Research Team to inform strategies for improving student engagement and retention.

### 2. [Global University Database and Dashboard](https://github.com/tthvan/Global-University-Analysis.git)
This project provides a relational **SQL database** designed to support a study abroad agency in **organizing, comparing, and presenting global university information** in a reusable and data-driven way. A **Tableau dashboard** is also created to **improve engagement** with the end users (parents and students) by providing them a user-friendly dashboard to compare their dream universities.

### 3. [Classifying-Tech-Startups-for-Partnership](https://github.com/tthvan/ML-Classifying-Tech-Startups-for-Partnership.git)
This project builds a simple, interpretable machine learning pipeline to help SME companies identify high-potential startup partners using only publicly available data on German digital tech startups.
